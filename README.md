<h2> About this repository: </h2>

For this project, we use machine learning classifier algorithmns to predict the booking of guests on hotels or AirBnB.

This is project is part of Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description: </h2>

We recieve a dataset with the informaiton of +7k bookings. The objective of this exercise is to use the data of bookings in order to predict the type of book of 3k additional guests. 

Some of the features analyzed include gender, age, destination, travel with children, stay length, etc. 

In order to achieve this, during this exercise we perform:

1. Data Engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Implementation of MLP, KNN, SCV, Decision Tree and Random Forests
4. Cross-validation as model assessment 
5. Confusion matrix for further model assessment
6. Prediction
7. Furhter analysis of our results

The final result is a model that has an accuracy of 79% based on cross-validation scores mean. The confussion matrix correctly predicts 88% of AirBnBs stays and 92% of hotel stays.
